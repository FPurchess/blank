## Why Blank works differently

Blank might work a little different than what you are used to in other editors. It is purely keyboard-based. That means there are no buttons to change the paragraph style or mark a text bold. Instead, there are a few, but very intuitive keyboard-shortcuts to do everything you want.

Blank and it's keyboard shortcuts have quite some advantages over a mouse-driven editor:

- your hands stay on the keyboard while writing
- that way you can stay sharp on your idea, while the editor takes care of the layout
- and makes you much faster during your creative process

You can find a full list of keyboard shortcuts here: https://github.com/FPurchess/blank#keyboard-shortcuts

## What's good to know

### Blank remembers your content

You might be in a hurry closing Blank without saving your changes. That's no problem. Blank remembers what you wrote and restores the last content upon the next start. This way, you can just open & close Blank without worrying about loosing anything.

### Unobtrusive Autocompletion

Blank comes with a hand-picked list of very unobtrusive autocompletion patterns that support your content-creation process.

Type `##` at the beginning of a line followed by a space to create a heading level 2. Type a dash `-` at the beginning of a line followed by a space to create a bullet list. Type `-->` followed by a space to create a right-arrow `→`. There are some more combinations waiting for you to be explored.
